       "<p>The <em>Chief Historian</em> is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in months! Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.</p> \n",
       "<p>As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a <em class=\"star\">star</em>. They figure the Chief Historian <em>must</em> be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get <em class=\"star\">fifty stars</em> on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.</p> \n",
       "<p>Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants <em class=\"star\">one star</em>. Good luck!</p> \n",
       "<p>You haven't even left yet and the group of Elvish Senior Historians has already hit a problem: their list of locations to check is currently <em>empty</em>. Eventually, someone decides that the best place to check first would be the Chief Historian's office.</p> \n",
       "<p>Upon pouring into the office, everyone confirms that the Chief Historian is indeed nowhere to be found. Instead, the Elves discover an assortment of notes and lists of historically significant locations! This seems to be the planning the Chief Historian was doing before he left. Perhaps these notes can be used to determine which locations to search?</p> \n",
       "<p>Throughout the Chief's office, the historically significant locations are listed not by name but by a unique number called the <em>location ID</em>. To make sure they don't miss anything, The Historians split into two groups, each searching the office and trying to create their own complete list of location IDs.</p> \n",
       "<p>There's just one problem: by holding the two lists up <em>side by side</em> (your puzzle input), it quickly becomes clear that the lists aren't very similar. Maybe you can help The Historians reconcile their lists?</p> \n",
       "<p>For example:</p> \n",
       "<pre><code>3   4\n",
       "4   3\n",

       "1   3\n",
       "3   9\n",
       "3   3\n",
       "</code></pre> \n",
       "<p>Maybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the <em>smallest number in the left list</em> with the <em>smallest number in the right list</em>, then the <em>second-smallest left number</em> with the <em>second-smallest right number</em>, and so on.</p> \n",
       "<p>Within each pair, figure out <em>how far apart</em> the two numbers are; you'll need to <em>add up all of those distances</em>. For example, if you pair up a <code>3</code> from the left list with a <code>7</code> from the right list, the distance apart is <code>4</code>; if you pair up a <code>9</code> with a <code>3</code>, the distance apart is <code>6</code>.</p> \n",
       "<p>In the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:</p> \n",
       "<ul> \n",
       " <li>The smallest number in the left list is <code>1</code>, and the smallest number in the right list is <code>3</code>. The distance between them is <code><em>2</em></code>.</li> \n",
       " <li>The second-smallest number in the left list is <code>2</code>, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another <code>3</code>. The distance between them is <code><em>1</em></code>.</li> \n",
       " <li>The third-smallest number in both lists is <code>3</code>, so the distance between them is <code><em>0</em></code>.</li> \n",
       " <li>The next numbers to pair up are <code>3</code> and <code>4</code>, a distance of <code><em>1</em></code>.</li> \n",
       " <li>The fifth-smallest numbers in each list are <code>3</code> and <code>5</code>, a distance of <code><em>2</em></code>.</li> \n",
       " <li>Finally, the largest number in the left list is <code>4</code>, while the largest number in the right list is <code>9</code>; these are a distance <code><em>5</em></code> apart.</li> \n",
       "</ul> \n",
       "<p>To find the <em>total distance</em> between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this is <code>2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5</code>, a total distance of <code><em>11</em></code>!</p> \n",

You're welcome to check the warehouse, though,\" says the mildly flustered shopkeeper at the <a href=\"/2020/day/2\">North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop</a>. The Historians head out to take a look.</p> \n",

       "<p>The computer appears to be trying to run a program, but its memory (your puzzle input) is <em>corrupted</em>. All of the instructions have been jumbled up!</p> \n",
       "<p>It seems like the goal of the program is just to <em>multiply some numbers</em>. It does that with instructions like <code>mul(X,Y)</code>, where <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are each 1-3 digit numbers. For instance, <code>mul(44,46)</code> multiplies <code>44</code> by <code>46</code> to get a result of <code>2024</code>. Similarly, <code>mul(123,4)</code> would multiply <code>123</code> by <code>4</code>.</p> \n",
       "<p>However, because the program's memory has been corrupted, there are also many invalid characters that should be <em>ignored</em>, even if they look like part of a <code>mul</code> instruction. Sequences like <code>mul(4*</code>, <code>mul(6,9!</code>, <code>?(12,34)</code>, or <code>mul ( 2 , 4 )</code> do <em>nothing</em>.</p> \n",

       "<p>For some reason, the Elves also need to know the <em>middle page number</em> of each update being printed.

       "<p>When you go to cross the bridge, you notice a group of engineers trying to repair it. (Apparently, it breaks pretty frequently.) You won't be able to cross until it's fixed.</p> \n",
       "<p>You ask how long it'll take; the engineers tell you that it only needs final calibrations, but some young elephants were playing nearby and <em>stole all the operators</em> from their calibration equations! They could finish the calibrations if only someone could determine which test values could possibly be produced by placing any combination of operators into their calibration equations (your puzzle input).</p> \n",
       "<p>For example:</p> \n",

       "<p>Each line represents a single equation. The test value appears before the colon on each line; it is your job to determine whether the remaining numbers can be combined with operators to produce the test value.</p> \n",
       "<p>Operators are <em>always evaluated left-to-right</em>, <em>not</em> according to precedence rules. Furthermore, numbers in the equations cannot be rearranged. Glancing into the jungle, you can see elephants holding two different types of operators: <em>add</em> (<code>+</code>) and <em>multiply</em> (<code>*</code>).</p> \n",
       "<p>Only three of the above equations can be made true by inserting operators:</p> \n",
       "<ul> \n",
       " <li><code>190: 10 19</code> has only one position that accepts an operator: between <code>10</code> and <code>19</code>. Choosing <code>+</code> would give <code>29</code>, but choosing <code>*</code> would give the test value (<code>10 * 19 = 190</code>).</li> \n",
       " <li><code>3267: 81 40 27</code> has two positions for operators. Of the four possible configurations of the operators, <em>two</em> cause the right side to match the test value: <code>81 + 40 * 27</code> and <code>81 * 40 + 27</code> both equal <code>3267</code> (when evaluated left-to-right)!</li> \n",

       "<p>The ancient civilization on <a href=\"/2019/day/20\">Pluto</a> was known for its ability to manipulate spacetime, and while The Historians explore their infinite corridors, you've noticed a strange set of physics-defying stones.</p> \n",
       "<p>At first glance, they seem like normal stones: they're arranged in a perfectly <em>straight line</em>, and each stone has a <em>number</em> engraved on it.</p> \n",
       "<p>The strange part is that every time you <span title=\"No, they're not statues. Why do you ask?\">blink</span>, the stones <em>change</em>.</p> \n",
       "<p>Sometimes, the number engraved on a stone changes. Other times, a stone might <em>split in two</em>, causing all the other stones to shift over a bit to make room in their perfectly straight line.</p> \n",
       "<p>As you observe them for a while, you find that the stones have a consistent behavior. Every time you blink, the stones each <em>simultaneously</em> change according to the <em>first applicable rule</em> in this list:</p> \n",

       " <li>If the stone is engraved with the number <code>0</code>, it is replaced by a stone engraved with the number <code>1</code>.</li> \n",

The left half of the digits are engraved on the new left stone, and the right half of the digits are engraved on the new right stone. (The new numbers don't keep extra leading zeroes: <code>1000</code> would become stones <code>10</code> and <code>0</code>.)</li> \n",
       " <li>If none of the other rules apply, the stone is replaced by a new stone; the old stone's number <em>multiplied by 2024</em> is engraved on the new stone.</li> \n",

       "<p>No matter how the stones change, their <em>order is preserved</em>, and they stay on their perfectly straight line.</p> \n",
       "<p>How will the stones evolve if you keep blinking at them? You take a note of the number engraved on each stone in the line (your puzzle input).</p> \n",
       "<p>If you have an arrangement of five stones engraved with the numbers <code>0 1 10 99 999</code> and you blink once, the stones transform as follows:</p> \n",
       "<ul> \n",
       " <li>The first stone, <code>0</code>, becomes a stone marked <code>1</code>.</li> \n",
       " <li>The second stone, <code>1</code>, is multiplied by 2024 to become <code>2024</code>.</li> \n",
       " <li>The third stone, <code>10</code>, is split into a stone marked <code>1</code> followed by a stone marked <code>0</code>.</li> \n",
       " <li>The fourth stone, <code>99</code>, is split into two stones marked <code>9</code>.</li> \n",

## Prerequisites

To use [Kotlin Notebook](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-notebook-overview.html) you need to have [IntelliJ IDEA **Ultimate**](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (paid version).

You can start a trial for 30 days, or use [Early Access](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/) version for free (not always available).

Install [Kotlin Notebook Plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/kotlin-notebook.html#install-plugin).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or use it as a template. Open it in IntelliJ IDEA.

2. Create a Notebook.

3. Get your Advent of Code token and set an environment variable.

Open the developer console on the Advent of Code website and grab the `session` cookie.

Then open Kotlin Notebook settings and set the environment variable `AOC_TOKEN`.

4. Use it!

Check out the example: [example.ipynb](example.ipynb)

```kotlin
val aoc = AocClient.fromEnv().interactiveDay(2019, 1)

aoc.viewPartOne()

aoc.input()

aoc.submitPartOne("...")

aoc.viewPartTwo()

aoc.submitPartOne("...")
```
> [!NOTE]
> To display the value in the Notebook â€” it needs to be on the last line of the block, or you can use `DISPLAY(...)` function.

## Troubleshooting

If you can't resolve framework classes, try to change this from `All Project Libraries` to `aoc.main`.

Don't forget to restart the Kernel after changing the dependencies.

## TODO

This project is not finished. I still have a few ideas I will hopefully get to implement.

- A way to run tests.
  - Perhaps a way to extract tests from the description automatically with LLM. Not sure if this is legal, though.
- Synchronize with server time.
- A way to receive a notification when you can submit again after failing.
- A way to fetch a puzzle as soon as it becomes available.
- Add proper utils module.
